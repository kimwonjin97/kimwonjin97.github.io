## Problem ðŸ˜ˆ
When trying to configure Powershell, I faced the issue of location in $PROFILE returning document folder inside Onedrive. Resolving was quite simple and it required disabling syncing local files to Onedrive. 

## Disabling syncing in Onedrive
As a default onedrive would attempt to sync certain files like desktop, documents, and pictures. We could manually disable this by 
1. first open the onedrive by clicking the Onedrive icon in the taskbar. 
2. navigate to the setting

3. in the backup section click "Manage backup"

</figure>

4. disable syncing for document
5. restart the computer.

Then the `$PROFILE` location is now changed from `C:\Users\{user}\Onedrive\Documents ... ` to `C:\Users\{user}\Documents\...`.
