# Stable vs Unstable
Sorting algorithm could be either stable or unstable depending on their ways of managing redundant element. 
For instance lets say we have array `[1, 5, 3, 4, 3, 2]`, and for repetitive element we put tag to make them distinguishable
`[1, 5, 3(1), 4, 3(2), 2]`. 
Now for stable sorting algorithm the <span style="color:red"> order of these repetitive elements are preserve <span> after sorting is completed, while unstable sorting is not.

So for our example, 
after stable sort -> [1, 2, 3(1), 3(2), 4, 5]
after unstable sort -> [1, 2, 3(2), 3(1), 4, 5]

## stable sorting algorithms
 - Insertion Sort
 - Merge sort
 - Bubble sort
 - Counting sort

## unstable sorting algorithms
 - Selection sort
 - Heap sort
 - Shell sort
 - Quick sort


# in-place sorting algorithm
The sorting algorithm that uses negligible amount of additional memory is an inplace algorithm.

## In-place sorting algorihtms
    - Insertion sort
    - Selection sort
    - Bubble sort
    - Shell sort
    - Heap sort
    - Quick sort (depends on the definition)
## Not In-place sorting algorithms
    - Merge sort
    - Counting sort
    - Radix sort
    - Bucket Sort
