Stack is a Last In First Out(LIFO) data structure. The class template acts as a wrapper to the underlying container and it pushes/pops the element from the back of the underlying container, known as the top of the stack.

```c++
template<
    class T,
    class Container = std::deque<T>
> class stack;
```

T - type of the stored element.
Container - The type of the underlying container to use to store the elements. The container must satisfy the requirements of [*SequenceContainer*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/SequenceContainer). Additionally, it must provide the following functions with the usual semantics

Lets try using different squential container and see how they performs.
