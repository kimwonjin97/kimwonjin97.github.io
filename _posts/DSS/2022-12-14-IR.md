>>4. <span style="color:green"><u>Information need</u></span>: A topic about which user desires to know more

<u>Information retreival</u> is <span style="color:red">finding</span> material(usually document) of an <span style="color:red">unstructured</span> nature(usually text) that satifies an information neeed from within <span style="color:red">large collection</span>.
