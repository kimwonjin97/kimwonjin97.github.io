In distributed systems, we require

1. **Coordination** between nodes: must agree on certain things
2. **High degree of parallelism**: nodes should work independently to make progress

Time gives up **point of reference** every machines knows how to keep track of without need for explicit communication

In this post we are going to see that time-keeping is not perfect and a ways to efficiently synchronize the clocks. 

## Why is time important?

- Distributed gaming - who grabbed an object first?
- Markets, auctions, trading - who issued order first?
- Multimedia synchronization for real-time teleconferencing
- target tracking, air traffic control, location positioning

## Real time clock(RTC, CMOSC, HWC)

RTC is referred to as **wall clock** time, and is used even when PC is hibernated or swtiched off. Its based on alternative low power source, with cheap quartz crystal, and inaccurate natures.

RTC synchronizes the system clock when computer is on, and it **should not** be confused with neigher of real-time computing or hardware clock

Computer clocks count oscillations of a crystal at a defined frequency.

## Universal Time Coordinated(UTC)

its **Universal** since it is a standard used around world & internet, independent from time zones, and could be easily converted to local time by adding/subtracking local time zone. Its **Coordinated** because 400 institutions contribute their estimates of current time(sing atomic clocks). UTC is built by combing these estimates

To measure the latency in distributed system, its better to measure the time in a single machine after the round trip around different nodes, then measuring time between two different machine. THis is because these node could be not precisely synchronized.

## Some definitions

1. Clock skew: Instantaneous difference between readings of two clocks
2. Clock drift: variation in frequency over time.
