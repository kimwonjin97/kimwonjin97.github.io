1. Iterative Development & the Unified process
    - Waterfall process: do everything and hope nothing changes
    - Iterative Development: Expect change
    - The Unified Process: Organize work throughout 4 phases


### 1st Part of the Unified Process
    - 7 parts of Inception
        - Vision
        - Proof of Concepts
        - Usage Case Modeling
        - Supplemental Specification
        - Risk Management Plan
        - Iterative Plan
        - Software Development Plan


### Defining Requirement**
- Functional, Usability, Reliability, Performance, Supportability, Implementation, Interface, Operation, Licensing

### Usage Cases
1. What is Use Case?
    - provides simple way to dicover and record system requirement
    - start by writing a story about how each actor or participant in our system will use our system. and actor is anything included in or uses your system  

2. 3 types of actors
    - Primary Users: person the system is designed for
    - Supporting actors: external computer system verifiers
    - offstage actors: outside elements that have an interest in our system but aren't key

3. What is Scenario?
    - Every use case is going to be built on a very specific scenario. Scenario documents a series of interactions between actors and your system and each actor could have numerous scenarios while interacting with your system
